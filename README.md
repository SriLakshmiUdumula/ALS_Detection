# ALS_Detection
This project focuses on detecting signs of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) using acoustic features extracted from speech recordings. It combines signal processing (via Praat/Parselmouth) and machine learning models (like XGBoost, Random Forest, and KNN) to identify patterns in voice that are indicative of ALS.
