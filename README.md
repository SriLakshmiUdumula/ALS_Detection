# ALS_Detection
This project focuses on detecting signs of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) using acoustic features extracted from speech recordings. It combines signal processing (via Praat/Parselmouth) and machine learning models (like XGBoost, Random Forest, and KNN) to identify patterns in voice that are indicative of ALS.
### ðŸ“š Dataset Source
This project is based on the [VOC-ALS dataset and study published in Nature Scientific Data (2024)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03597-2), which contains a multimodal voice dataset for ALS detection.
